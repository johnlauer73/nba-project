Project Breakdown: Game Performance Dashboard (ETL Pipeline + AWS QuickSight)
Objective:
Develop an end-to-end data pipeline that collects, processes, and visualizes NBA game data. The pipeline will:

Collect game data from the NBA API.
Process and store it in AWS S3 in a structured format.
Analyze the data using AWS Athena.
Visualize the metrics using AWS QuickSight for insights into team performance, player stats, and trends.
Core Requirements:
NBA API:

Purpose: Pull real-time or historical data on NBA games, teams, players, etc.
Tools/Resources:
Find a publicly available NBA API, like NBA API (pyNBA), or scrape data from official sources like NBA Stats.
Outcome: Retrieve data on team performance, player stats, and game details.
Data Processing & Storage (AWS S3):

Purpose: Store fetched data in a structured format (e.g., Parquet or JSON).
Tools/Resources:
AWS S3 for storage.
Boto3 Python library to interact with S3.
Convert API response data into Parquet or CSV for easy querying and processing later.
Outcome: Organize and store the data securely and in a highly accessible format.
Data Processing & Analysis (AWS Glue + Athena):

Purpose: Transform and prepare data for analysis.
Tools/Resources:
AWS Glue for ETL jobs. Use AWS Glue Crawlers to automatically detect data schema.
AWS Athena to query data directly from S3 without the need for complex infrastructure.
Use Python to automate data transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregations).
Outcome: Process the raw game data and create cleaned, queryable data for analysis.
Data Visualization (AWS QuickSight):

Purpose: Create a dashboard to display actionable insights from the processed data.
Tools/Resources:
AWS QuickSight to create visualizations like bar charts, time-series graphs, and heatmaps for player stats, team performance, etc.
Outcome: A fully functional dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as team win rates, player stats, etc.
CI/CD Pipeline for Automation:

Purpose: Automate data pipeline deployment, data processing, and testing.
Tools/Resources:
GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows (trigger ETL process, deploy new changes).
Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure (e.g., S3 bucket, Glue jobs).
Outcome: A robust pipeline that automatically triggers data processing jobs and deployment updates.
Desired Outcomes:
Data Pipeline Automation:

An automated ETL process that fetches data from the NBA API, stores it in S3, processes it using AWS Glue, and stores it in a format suitable for querying with Athena.
Python scripts to automate the fetching of data, transforming it, and storing it in AWS.
Efficient Data Storage and Querying:

Data in S3 is organized in Parquet or CSV format for easy querying and analysis.
AWS Athena queries the stored data to extract meaningful insights about NBA teams and players.
Insightful Dashboards:

Create at least 3-5 key visualizations in AWS QuickSight:
Team Performance (win rates, points per game).
Player Stats (average points, rebounds, assists).
Game Performance Trends (e.g., home vs. away game stats).
Provide filtering options by team, player, or season.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Automate the data pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.
Use Terraform to create and manage AWS resources, ensuring the pipeline is scalable and maintainable.
Resources to Use:
NBA API:

NBA API (pyNBA) or other NBA-related APIs for real-time data. You may also consider web scraping if necessary.
AWS Services:

S3: Store raw and processed data.
AWS Glue: Run ETL jobs for processing data.
Athena: Query data stored in S3.
QuickSight: Visualize data for reporting.
Lambda (optional): For triggering ETL processes or periodic data fetches.
CloudWatch: For logging and monitoring the Lambda functions, Glue jobs, and overall pipeline health.
Python Libraries:

Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with S3, Glue, etc.
Pandas: Data manipulation and transformation.
Pytest: For unit testing your scripts.
Requests or HTTPx: For fetching data from the NBA API.
CI/CD & Infrastructure Management:

GitHub Actions: Automate testing, deployment, and running of the ETL pipeline.
Terraform: Manage and provision AWS resources programmatically.
Docker (optional): For containerizing your Python application, especially if running locally or in a Kubernetes environment.
Project Phases:
Phase 1: Data Collection and Storage

Set up the NBA API data fetching script in Python.
Store the data in AWS S3 in CSV or Parquet format.
Test the integration by fetching a sample dataset.
Phase 2: Data Processing

Use AWS Glue to create an ETL job that processes the data in S3.
Use Athena to query the transformed data and ensure everything is accurate.
Phase 3: Data Visualization

Set up AWS QuickSight and connect it to Athena.
Create a dashboard with visualizations like team performance, player stats, and game trends.
Phase 4: Automation & CI/CD

Automate the data pipeline with GitHub Actions.
Use Terraform to provision all necessary AWS resources (S3 buckets, Glue jobs, QuickSight datasets).
